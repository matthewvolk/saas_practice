        <hr />
        <p>My name is Matthew Volk, and I am a 22 year old post grad teaching myself backend programming
        with Ruby on Rails.</p>
        <p>This project is a fictional software in which users interact in a two sided marketplace. 
        Sellers are able to sell photography to content providers in need of high
        resolution images. Perfect for businesses with social media needs, and perfect
        for photographers who need a place to get rid of all of their extra photos.</p>
